This script has two parts that will eventually be merged into one big script. ( yea i know, overkill, am i right?) 
This script will get rid of defender. Upon testing on my end, it didnt break anything that was not already broken. 
 

use common sense and backup your stuff, I am not responsible for anything this breaks. You break it? you fix it. Im not saying my script is perfect.. In fact im sure its far from it, and that there are other far more eaiser ones to do . But anyways. 

all my yapping aside, use this if you want to get rid of windows defender. 
THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED ON S MODE SYSTEMS or any other systems other than the standard home and pro editons.
