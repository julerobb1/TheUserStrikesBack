This is a utility (script) to fully remove windows defender. USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK! 
YOU AS THE USER ACCEPT ALL LIABILITY FOR RUNNING WITHOUT AN ANTIVIRUS. 
NOTE: THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF WINDOWS IS INSTALLED, AND YOU ARE IN WINDOWS PE (Bootable Media, eg. Installation media built with an official Microsoft ISO.) 
Additionally, This script assumes you've already run the defender removal script from https://privacy.sexy as either an administrator or TrustedInstaller/SYSTEM (using either PSEXEC or NSudo)) 
I don't expect this to break anyhting, but it might. I'd highly reccomend making a backup and system image of your system, just to err on the side of caution. 

Yes I know i could just use the registry key, but what good does that do you when the program wont even acknowledge the DisableAntiSpyware entry after microsoft killed the killswitch? 
Plus not all editions of Windows let you use the Group Policy editor. 
And I know this is a bit of a nuclear approach as it completely wipes out defender, but it gets the job done, assuming you dont run a DISM repair, then you're back to square one. 
But when you're consistently running low on memory with next to nothing installed on windows and antimalware service cannot be disabled.. you get tired of it eventually and say "I ain' avin it!" or "'eres me 'ammer?" as Andy Moir says.. 

( thank you Photoninduction for hours of entertainment, you my friend have inspired me to do tech shenanigans with your electrical shenanigans)

Script will be added at a later date. 

THIS COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, IT IS DISTRIBUTED AS IS. THIS ASSUMES YOU ARE THE SOLE OWNER OF THE COMPUTER AND YOU ACCEPT RESPONISBILIY FOR POSSIBLE DATA LOSS, LOSS OF PRODUCTIVITY, AND ANY ARGUMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THIS. 
THIS SCRIPT ALSO ASSUMES YOU ARE COMPETENT, HAVE COMPLETED THE FIFTH GRADE, ARE AN ACTUAL HUMAN BEING, NOT A POTATO.  IF YOU ARE A POTATO CEASE USE AND SEEK THE NEAREST POTATO PEELER NEARBY IMMEDIATELY. I AM IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR WHATEVER HAPPENS TO YOUR PC. 

BY DOWNLOADING THIS SCRIPT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE YOU ARE WELL PREPARED FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND HAVE **_EVERYTHING IMPORTANT BACKED UP IN A SAFE PLACE, REPLICATED IN MULTIPLE FORMATS AND LOCATIONS, WITH RECOVERY MEDIA ON HAND!_**
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE ANTI-VIRUS SOLIUTION READY TO GO. THIS SCRIPT HAS BEEN TESTED ON WINDOWS 11 PRO/PRO WORKSTATION ENLISH, USA x64 ONLY. 

Jokes and legal disclaimer aside, this is absolutely a run at your own risk program. And it may or may not have the desired results, it may not do anyhting, or it may do more than that.  Long story short, your mileage may vary. 
On the other hand, if you're a 'hacker' so to speak use this program for good, not evil. The last thing we need is more crap built into windows. it already hogs ram as is. 

Again, run this at your own risk. I am not responisble if it breaks your shit. You're the one who chose to use script, not me.. YOU, the END USER. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS, NOT ME.
