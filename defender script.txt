This is a utility (script) to fully remove windows defender. USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK! YOU AS THE USER ACCEPT ALL LIABILITY FOR RUNNING WITHOUT AN ANTIVIRUS. NOTE: THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF WINDOWS IS INSTALLED, AND YOU ARE IN WINDOWS PE (Bootable Media, eg. Installation media built with an official Microsoft ISO.) This script assumes you've already run the defender removal script from https://privacy.sexy as either an administrator or TrustedInstaller/SYSTEM (using either PSEXEC or NSudo))
